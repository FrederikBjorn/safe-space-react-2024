/* 
  A NEW APPROACH TO DEFINING AND NAMING COLORS:

  All the latest shades of blue below were defined and named using this guide:
  https://www.refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette 

  The numerical values in the name of each shade describe its brightness level on a scale:
  - grey100 is the brightest
  - grey500 is the darkest

  All other colors in the application will be revised using the same pattern on an ongoing basis.
